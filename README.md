# Music-PlayList-Java-LL-Practice
Custom music playlist where the I can add songs from specific albums. 
3 classes (Main(ofc), Album, Song), each with specific interconnected methods (private & public).
My solution for Coding Exercise 46 (Java Programming MasterClass). Linked List practice.
Implemented menu where user can exit, skip the song, go back to previous song, replay song, remove song from playlist and check the entire playlist
